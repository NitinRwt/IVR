<h1># Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System for Healthcare</h1> 
This project demonstrates an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system for a healthcare application using Flask and Twilio. The system handles incoming phone calls, presents a menu to the user, and processes user input.

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/): A web framework for Python used to handle incoming calls and responses.
- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/): A cloud communications platform used to interact with phone calls and send/receive SMS messages.
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/): An open-source natural language processing library for Python.
